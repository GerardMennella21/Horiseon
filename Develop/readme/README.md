Horiseon Page - by Gerard Mennella

# Summary

This is a page to demonstrate the functions of horiseon, a marketing company for businesses. I hope to meet the pages expectations while keeping the code as efficient as possible.

# Code Breakdown

The header contains the h1 element with the requested alternating colors as well as three functioning links in an unordered list. The links take you to the various sections with corresponding names on the same page. They appear inline in the nav element with appropriate space between them.

The hero section appears next on the page with the requested image and specifications defined in the css file.

The content section appears after the hero section with 3 subsections for Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing. The styles for the content sections are identical and defined in the css file using the matching elements in the section. The sections are floated appropriately left/right in accordance with the mock-up. The images in this section have all been given appropriate alt attributes for full accessibility.

The benefits section appears next and is floated to the right of the previous content section. It contains a subsection for each of the three benefits, Lead Generation, Brand Awareness and Cost Management. This section's styles were defined by corresponding elements as most of the properties are shared by all three subsections. The images in this section have all been given appropriate alt attributes for full accessibility.

The footer is at the next and last section on the page. It contains the requested h2 element "Made with ❤️️ by Horiseon" as well as the copyright.
